# Interest Rate Changes and Household Debt Management in Australia
This project analyses how changes in Australia’s cash rate affected household debt behaviour between 2015 and 2025, and discusses the implications for household debt management in 2026.

The focus is on understanding whether households adjusted their borrowing behaviour in response to rising interest rates, rather than predicting exact future outcomes.


# Research Questions
- How did household debt indicators respond to changes in the cash rate?
- Do these changes suggest that households actively managed debt servicing pressure?
- What implications can be drawn for household borrowing behaviour in 2026?


## Data
The analysis uses publicly available data from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), including:
- Quarterly cash rate data (2015–2025)
- Household and Business Balance Sheets
- Household Finances: Selected Ratios

Direct data on fixed-rate and variable-rate loan shares are not available for the full sample period. As a result, household borrowing behaviour is analysed using indirect indicators such as debt-to-income and debt-to-assets ratios.


## Methodology
- Quarterly data are classified into different interest rate regimes (easing, stable, tightening).
- Household debt-to-income and debt-to-assets ratios are examined alongside changes in the cash rate.
- Graphical analysis is used to identify behavioural patterns rather than estimate causal effects.
- The analysis focuses on interpreting household responses to different interest rate environments.


## Key Findings
- Household debt-to-income ratios declined during the rapid interest rate tightening period from 2022 onwards.
- Household debt-to-assets ratios remained relatively stable, suggesting balance sheet resilience.
- These patterns indicate that households adjusted borrowing behaviour and relied on asset buffers to manage rising debt servicing pressure.
